        <p>The club isn't the best place to find a lover<br>
        So the bar is where I go<br>
        Me and my friends at the table doing shots<br>
        Drinking fast and then we talk slow<br>
        Come over and start up a conversation with just me<br>
        And trust me I'll give it a chance now<br>
        Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox<br>
        And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like</p>

       <p> Girl, you know I want your love<br>
        Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
        Come on now, follow my lead<br>
        I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
        Say, boy, let's not talk too much<br>
        Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
        Come on now, follow my lead</p>

        <p>Come, come on now, follow my lead<br>
        I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
        We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
        Although my heart is falling too<br>
        I'm in love with your body<br>
        Last night you were in my room<br>
        And now my bedsheets smell like you<br>
        Every day discovering something brand new<br>
        I'm in love with your body<br>
        (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)<br>
        I'm in love with your body<br>
        (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)<br>
        I'm in love with your body<br>
        (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)<br>
        I'm in love with your body<br>
        Every day discovering something brand new<br>
        I'm in love with the shape of you</p>

        <p>One week in we let the story begin<br>
        We're going out on our first date<br>
        You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat<br>
        Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate<br>
        We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour<br>
        And how your family is doing okay<br>
        Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat<br>
        Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like</p>

        <p>Girl, you know I want your love<br>
        Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
        Come on now, follow my lead<br>
        I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
        Say, boy, let's not talk too much<br>
        Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
        Come on now, follow my lead<br>
        Come, come on now, follow my lead</p>

       <p> I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
        We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
        Although my heart is falling too<br>
        I'm in love with your body<br>
        Last night you were in my room<br>
        And now my bedsheets smell like you<br>
        Every day discovering something brand new<br>
        I'm in love with your body<br>
        (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)<br>

        I'm in love with your body<br>
        Every day discovering something brand new<br>
        I'm in love with the shape of you</p>

        <p>Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on<br>

        Come on (I'm in love with your body), be my baby, come on<br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
